Git 2.26 Release Notes
======================

Updates since v2.25
-------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Sample credential helper for using .netrc has been updated to work
   out of the box.

 * gpg.minTrustLevel configuration variable has been introduced to
   tell various signature verification codepaths the required minimum
   trust level.

 * The command line completion (in contrib/) learned to complete
   subcommands and arguments to "git worktree".


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Tell .editorconfig that in this project, *.txt files are indented
   with tabs.

 * The test-lint machinery knew to check "VAR=VAL shell_function"
   construct, but did not check "VAR= shell_funciton", which has been
   corrected.

 * Replace "git config --bool" calls with "git config --type=bool" in
   sample templates.


Fixes since v2.25
-----------------

 * "git commit" gives output similar to "git status" when there is
   nothing to commit, but without honoring the advise.statusHints
   configuration variable, which has been corrected.
   (merge 5c4f55f1f6 hw/commit-advise-while-rejecting later to maint).

 * has_object_file() said "no" given an object registered to the
   system via pretend_object_file(), making it inconsistent with
   read_object_file(), causing lazy fetch to attempt fetching an
   empty tree from promisor remotes.
   (merge 9c8a294a1a jt/sha1-file-remove-oi-skip-cached later to maint).

 * Complete an update to tutorial that encourages "git switch" over
   "git checkout" that was done only half-way.
   (merge 1a7e454dd6 hw/tutorial-favor-switch-over-checkout later to maint).

 * C pedantry ;-) fix.
   (merge 63ab08fb99 bc/run-command-nullness-after-free-fix later to maint).

 * The code that tries to skip over the entries for the paths in a
   single directory using the cache-tree was not careful enough
   against corrupt index file.
   (merge 573117dfa5 es/unpack-trees-oob-fix later to maint).

 * Reduce unnecessary round-trip when running "ls-remote" over the
   stateless RPC mechanism.
   (merge 4d8cab95cc jk/no-flush-upon-disconnecting-slrpc-transport later to maint).

 * "git restore --staged" did not correctly update the cache-tree
   structure, resulting in bogus trees to be written afterwards, which
   has been corrected.
   (merge e701bab3e9 nd/switch-and-restore later to maint).

 * The code recently added to move to the entry beyond the ones in the
   same directory in the index in the sparse-cone mode did not count
   the number of entries to skip over incorrectly, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge 7210ca4ee5 ds/sparse-cone later to maint).

 * Rendering by "git log --graph" of ancestry lines leading to a merge
   commit were made suboptimal to waste vertical space a bit with a
   recent update, which has been corrected.
   (merge c958d3bd0a ds/graph-horizontal-edges later to maint).

 * Work around test breakages caused by custom regex engine used in
   libasan, when address sanitizer is used with more recent versions
   of gcc and clang.
   (merge f65d07fffa jk/asan-build-fix later to maint).

 * Minor bugfixes to "git add -i" that has recently been rewritten in C.
   (merge 849e43cc18 js/builtin-add-i-cmds later to maint).

 * "git fetch --refmap=" option has got a better documentation.
   (merge b40a50264a ds/refmap-doc later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge 26f924d50e en/simplify-check-updates-in-unpack-trees later to maint).
