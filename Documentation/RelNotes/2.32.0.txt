Git 2.32 Release Notes
======================

Backward compatibility notes
----------------------------

 * ".gitattributes", ".gitignore", and ".mailmap" files that are
   symbolic links are ignored.


Updates since v2.31
-------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * It does not make sense to make ".gitattributes", ".gitignore" and
   ".mailmap" symlinks, as they are supposed to be usable from the
   object store (think: bare repositories where HEAD:.mailmap etc. are
   used).  When these files are symbolic links, we used to read the
   contents of the files pointed by them by mistake, which has been
   corrected.

 * "git stash show" learned to optionally show untracked part of the
   stash.

 * "git log --format='...'" learned "%(describe)" placeholder.

 * "git repack" so far has been only capable of repacking everything
   under the sun into a single pack (or split by size).  A cleverer
   strategy to reduce the cost of repacking a repository has been
   introduced.

 * The http codepath learned to let the credential layer to cache the
   password used to unlock a certificate that has successfully been
   used.

 * "git commit --fixup=<commit>", which was to tweak the changes made
   to the contents while keeping the original log message intact,
   learned "--fixup=(amend|reword):<commit>", that can be used to
   tweak both the message and the contents, and only the message,
   respectively.

 * When accessing a server with a URL like https://user:pass@site/, we
   did not to fall back to the basic authentication with the
   credential material embedded in the URL after the "Negotiate"
   authentication failed.  Now we do.

 * "git send-email" learned to honor the core.hooksPath configuration.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Rename detection rework continues.

 * GIT_TEST_FAIL_PREREQS is a mechanism to skip test pieces with
   prerequisites to catch broken tests that depend on the side effects
   of optional pieces, but did not work at all when negative
   prerequisites were involved.
   (merge 27d578d904 jk/fail-prereq-testfix later to maint).

 * "git diff-index" codepath has been taught to trust fsmonitor status
   to reduce number of lstat() calls.
   (merge 7e5aa13d2c nk/diff-index-fsmonitor later to maint).

 * Reorganize Makefile to allow building git.o and other essential
   objects without extra stuff needed only for testing.



Fixes since v2.31
-----------------

 * The fsmonitor interface read from its input without making sure
   there is something to read from.  This bug is new in 2.31
   timeframe.

 * The data structure used by fsmonitor interface was not properly
   duplicated during an in-core merge, leading to use-after-free etc.

 * "git bisect" reimplemented more in C during 2.30 timeframe did not
   take an annotated tag as a good/bad endpoint well.  This regression
   has been corrected.

 * Fix macros that can silently inject unintended null-statements.

 * CALLOC_ARRAY() macro replaces many uses of xcalloc().

 * Update insn in Makefile comments to run fuzz-all target.

 * Fix a corner case bug in "git mv" on case insensitive systems,
   which was introduced in 2.29 timeframe.

 * We had a code to diagnose and die cleanly when a required
   clean/smudge filter is missing, but an assert before that
   unnecessarily fired, hiding the end-user facing die() message.
   (merge 6fab35f748 mt/cleanly-die-upon-missing-required-filter later to maint).

 * Update C code that sets a few configuration variables when a remote
   is configured so that it spells configuration variable names in the
   canonical camelCase.
   (merge 0f1da600e6 ab/remote-write-config-in-camel-case later to maint).

 * A new configuration variable has been introduced to allow choosing
   which version of the generation number gets used in the
   commit-graph file.
   (merge 702110aac6 ds/commit-graph-generation-config later to maint).

 * Perf test update to work better in secondary worktrees.
   (merge 36e834abc1 jk/perf-in-worktrees later to maint).

 * Updates to memory allocation code around the use of pcre2 library.
   (merge c1760352e0 ab/grep-pcre2-allocfix later to maint).

 * "git -c core.bare=false clone --bare ..." would have segfaulted,
   which has been corrected.
   (merge 75555676ad bc/clone-bare-with-conflicting-config later to maint).

 * When "git checkout" removes a path that does not exist in the
   commit it is checking out, it wasn't careful enough not to follow
   symbolic links, which has been corrected.
   (merge fab78a0c3d mt/checkout-remove-nofollow later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge f451960708 dl/cat-file-doc-cleanup later to maint).
